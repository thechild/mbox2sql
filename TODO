* Hide attachments that are embedded small images (not sure what right cutoff is)
* add an attachments page where I can view and search for files (list of filename, sender, subject, etc)
* add search in general (maybe with a dropdown for search by person, message, attachment, etc)
* add unread/read? or maybe a better tagging system (new, todo, etc, so each message goes into a bucket)
* combine threads - backend code is mostly there (I think) but need to update the front end to show it.
    - change the message list to only show the newest message from each thread (or each thread once) and have a column for # messages in thread
    - change the message view page to show all messages in a thread
    - change the message view page to hide replies in the message  view (have a list of "start of next message" phrases that it can compress on - like "In Reply To" etc)
    - change the person page to show threads the person is involved in in addition to just sent messages
